Attendees:

- Stephen Curran
- And others...


1. Welcome and Adminstrivia
    1. Recording on?
    2. Please make sure you: [join DIF], [sign the WG Charter], and follow the [DIF Code of Conduct]. Questions? Please contact [operations@identity.foundation].
    3. [did:tdw Specification license] -- W3C Mode
    4. Introductions and Agenda Topics
2. Latest spec updates and implementation notes.
    1. Cleaning up `[[spec]]` references -- Brian has enabled us to add our own spec references.
    2. Next up -- DRYing the. spec.
    3. Security and Privacy sections. Anyone able to help?
    4. Getting "spec to a standard" advice and applying those changes.
3. Registering did:tdw as a DID Method [PR](https://github.com/w3c/did-extensions/pull/581), and adding a did:tdw component to the [Universal Resolver](https://dev.uniresolver.io/).
4. [DID Linked Resources](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/DID-Linked-Resources/) and did:tdw
    1.  Mechanisms to publish/resolve files related to the DID -- e.g., AnonCreds objects, OCA Files, BitListStatus, etc.
    2.  DID Linked Resources vs. `relativeRef` [currently in the spec](https://identity.foundation/trustdidweb/#did-url-path-resolution-service)
    3.  Complexity of DID Linked Resources is that the DLRs must be listed somewhere so they can be included in the DID Metadata that is part of the DID resolution result.
        4.  Use case: Clients of resolvers find a DID URL for the resources. With `relativeRef` there is the same DID-To-HTTPS transformation to get the resource as to get the DID Log/DID Doc.
        5.  Use case: A resource points to a sequence of related documents, as in the case of RevRegEntries in AnonCreds. One identifier, but multiple resources. How does one find (a) the latest, (b) the entire list of entries (c) a specific entry at a given time? Each of those features could be needed with RevRegEntries.
4. [Spec. PRs and Issues](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/trustdidweb/issues)
    1.  Issues that would be [breaking changes](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/trustdidweb/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Adiscuss) -- close them?

    2. Please make sure you: [join DIF], [sign the WG Charter], and follow the [DIF Code of Conduct]. Questions? Please contact [operations@identity.foundation].
    3. [did:tdw Specification license] -- W3C Mode
    4. Introductions and Agenda Topics
2. Feedback from implementing `did:tdw` Witness capability -- Brian Richter.
    1. Resolver has a /witness endpoint -- got the request from the DID Controller.
    2. Stuck on signing the entry. Both log entries have a did:key -- the witnesses must be published DIDs -- **SHOULD** be a did:tdw?
    3. Where to send the witness request? The DID Controller should know that. 
    4. Perhaps add an endpoint for the witnesses in the `witnesses` object? Decided no -- not to include the endpoint since that puts too much definition in the specification on how to implement the DID Controller and Witness interface. It is left to the DID Controller and witnesses to decide how they will interact. All that is specified is that  resolvers can verify the proofs via the DID referenced in the `witnesses` object, and the key identifier that references that DID in the proof itself.
    5. Use cases for witnesses -- (1) monitoring the DID controller to prevent maliciousness -- no backtracking, (2) preventing attacks on the DID Controller.
    6. Next steps -- Brian to continue implementing based on the discussion. Addition of weasel words to the spec to note the implementation challenges.
4. Spec. update to switch from a DID log entry being a JSON array to an object.  Feedback? -- Stephen Curran. Good to go with the names of the items in the object.
    1. General feedback -- all good.
    2. We reviewed the names and agreed with the ones in the PR now -- `versionId`, `versionTime` (both of which align with the DID Core spec query parameters), `parameters`, and `state`. `proof` is as defined in the DI specification.
6. Proof Chain vs. Proof Set
    1. Semantics:
        1. Proof Chain implies that that a subsequent signature is added to an existing signature, implying an attestation of that signature. But there are no implementations of it that we know of, and it's inclusion adds complexity without the semantics giving much benefit in `did:tdw`.
        2. Proof sets are just independent proofs across the same data.
    3. For now, let's just go with proof sets, as there is little benefit from using proof chains.
7. Update on the [did:tdw Web Server](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/trustdidweb-server-py) -- Patrick St. Louis.
    8. Demo given, but we ran out of time.
9. [DID Linked Resources](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/DID-Linked-Resources/) and did:tdw
    1. Should we?
10. [Spec. PRs and Issues](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/trustdidweb)
11. Open Discussion
